    <h2> Poem - Vanishing Grounds:</h2>
    <p>
           Oh, Vanishing Grounds, how grand and profound,
        Where solid earth decides it’s time to go to ground. 
        With each step you take, it's like a magic trick, 
        Ground disappearing beneath you, oh so slick! 
        
        Who needs solid footing, stable and strong? 
        When you can dance on air all day long! 
        The thrill of uncertainty, it's just divine, 
        Oh, Vanishing Grounds, you're so sublime! 
        
        Watch your step, or not, who really cares? 
        Falling into oblivion, who wouldn’t dare? 
        Navigating this terrain, what a hoot, 
        Vanishing Grounds, the ultimate pursuit! 
        
        Oh, the joy of never knowing where to tread, 
        Every path a leap of faith, no fear, no dread. 
        So here's to you, Vanishing Grounds, so sly, 
        Turning solid ground into a great big lie! </p>

                backtracks on promises. He once reached such heights of forgetfulness that he couldn't even remember his own name, 
                spending an entire day responding to "Hey, you!" with a bewildered expression.His keys? They've gone on more adventures 
                than a lost puppy, leading to an endless parade of comedic catastrophes. Despite his complete lack of mental faculty, 
                Kevin's escapades never fail to provide amusement, as he stumbles through life leaving chaos and confusion in his wake. 
                one might pity him for his forgetfulness, but to those who witness his antics, he's nothing short of a sidesplitting spectacle 
                 . So here's to Kevin "Memory Like a Goldfish" Robinson, the forgetful legend whose antics serve as a daily reminder that life is 
                just one big comedy of errors.   </p>
